<h3>The Riesz-Markov-Kakutani representation theorem</h3>
Let $\Omega$ be a locally compact Hausdorff space.
Then, for every bounded linear functional $I$ on the space $C_0(\Omega)$ of complex-valued continuous functions vanishing at infinity, there exists a unique regular finite complex Borel measure $\mu$ on $\Omega$ such that
\[I(f)=\int f\,d\mu\]
for all $f\in C_0(\Omega)$.
