<h2>About</h2>

<p>
	Hi, my name is Ikhan Choi (최익한).
	My surname is pronounced officially as "Chwe (チェ)", but I prefer to be called "Choy (チョイ)".
</p>
<p>
	I am from Korea and a first-year graduate student at the University of Tokyo under the advice of <a href='https://www.ms.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~yasuyuki/index-e.html'>Yasuyuki Kawahigashi</a>.
	I am grateful to have been selected as a recipient of the Japanese government (MEXT) scholarship.
</p>
<p>
	My research interests primarily lie in operator algebras and abstract harmonic analysis, and their applications to other areas of mathematics such as representation theory, differential geometry, and mathematical physics.
</p>
<p>
  The official CV file can be found <a href='/assets/tex/cv/cv.pdf'>here</a>.

<p>
  I am an amateur saxophonist, and also interested in computer graphics and physics simulations.
