<p>Totally boundedness is a way of descibing compactness in metric spaces.
It can be generalized to uniform spaces in general, which do not allow
the use of sequences. Related to this, I found a proof mistake on the
celebrated book on general topology written by Stephen Willard. The
purpose of this post is to fix the proof and practice the usage of
subnets by generalizing the theorem.</p>
